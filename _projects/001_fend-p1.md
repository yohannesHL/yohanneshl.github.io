Here I demonstrate usage of bootstrap framework to transform a mockup to an actual webpage.

The udacity algorithm compaired the origional mockup with the generated web page and measure the total mismatch between the two in percentage.

The goal was to get a mismatch score of 4% or lower. I was able to get a missmatch of 0% and produce a pixel perfect match to the original.
