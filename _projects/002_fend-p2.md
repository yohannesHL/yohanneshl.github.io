In this is project i've used Javascript, jQuery and templating techniques to create a dynamic resume page. Real and Fake data was used for the content. All essential code for displaying resume sections were incapsulated within namespaces and adhere to the udacity [style guide](https://udacity.github.io/frontend-nanodegree-styleguide/).
