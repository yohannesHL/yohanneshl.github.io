For this Project I developed a responsive Google map application using Knockout MVVM library. The App was made for people to search for properties in a location subject to localities they prefer to be close to. Eg Property near Park, Cafe,SuperMarket, etc.

Upon entering a location in the search box users will be shown an autocomplete list with a list of suggestion. Once a search is made the users would be shown a listing of properies on side pane that slides out. The locations will also be marked with custom marker on the map.

 I used Karma+Jasmine for testing and Gulp to automate the build process.
