# Property Rental map
 > used Karma+Jasmine for testing and Gulp to automate the build process.
 
A single-page web application, built using the Knockout framework, that displays a Google Map of an area and various points of interest. Users can search all included landmarks and, when selected, additional information about a landmark is presented from the Google Places API.  Available properties near the search location, retrieved from Zoopla API, are listed on a side panel.
