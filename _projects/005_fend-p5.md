# Property Rental map

A single-page web application, built using the Knockout framework, that displays a Google Map of an area and various points of interest. Users can search all included landmarks and, when selected, additional information about a landmark is presented from the Google Places API.  Available properties near the search location, retrieved from Zoopla API, are listed on a side panel.
